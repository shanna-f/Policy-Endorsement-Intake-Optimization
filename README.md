# Policy Endorsement Intake Optimization  
**Business Analysis Case Study (Fictional Company)**

## 📌 Overview
This case study demonstrates how I approach complex, real-world operational problems as a **Senior IT Business Analyst**—from problem framing and current-state analysis through future-state design, financial justification, and implementation planning.

The project focuses on optimizing **policy endorsement intake and processing** within a property & casualty insurance context by introducing **complexity-based triage and differentiated workflows**.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This case study is based on a fictional company and anonymized scenarios. It is intended solely to demonstrate my business analysis approach, thinking, and deliverables.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Policy Operations was experiencing growing backlogs and long turnaround times for **simple, low-risk policy endorsements** (e.g., address changes, administrative updates).

### Key Issues Identified
- All endorsement requests entered a **single intake queue**
- Simple and complex requests followed the **same workflow**
- Low-risk work waited behind high-effort endorsements
- Compliance checks occurred **late in the process**
- Limited visibility into workload by endorsement type and aging

### Business Impact
- Increased turnaround times for routine changes  
- Inefficient use of skilled Policy Operations resources  
- Frustration for agents and policyholders  
- Limited ability for managers to proactively manage workload and service levels  

---

## 🧠 My Role
As the **Business Analyst**, I was responsible for:

- Framing the problem and defining success criteria  
- Documenting current-state processes and pain points  
- Facilitating alignment across Operations, Compliance, and IT  
- Performing gap analysis and evaluating solution options  
- Designing the future-state workflow and triage logic  
- Defining goals, SMART objectives, KPIs, and success metrics  
- Building the cost–benefit analysis and ROI justification  
- Supporting governance, implementation planning, and transition to operations

## 🔍 Approach & Key Deliverables

### 1. Current-State Analysis
I documented the end-to-end endorsement intake and processing workflow to understand how work actually flowed through the organization.

**Key insight:**  
> The core constraint was not endorsement volume—it was the lack of differentiation at intake, which caused low-risk work to be processed as if it were high-risk.

---

### 2. Gap Analysis
I compared the current state to a clearly defined future state to identify root causes and solution opportunities.

| Area        | Current State            | Future State                              |
|-------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Intake      | Single queue             | Complexity-based triage                   |
| Processing  | One-size-fits-all         | Fast-track vs. standard workflows         |
| Visibility  | Limited reporting         | Dashboards by type and aging              |
| Compliance  | Late-stage review         | Embedded, rule-based checks               |

---

### 3. Future-State Design
I designed a **decision-based workflow** that classifies endorsements at intake and routes them through differentiated processing paths.

#### Key Features
- Complexity-based triage using predefined business and compliance rules  
- Fast-track workflow for simple, low-risk endorsements  
- Standard workflow retained for complex endorsements  
- Embedded compliance checks to maintain auditability  
- Dashboards to provide real-time operational visibility  

---

### 4. Options Analysis
Three solution paths were evaluated:

1. **Do Nothing** – No cost, no improvement  
2. **Partial Triage** – Limited gains, short-term improvement  
3. **Full Process Optimization** ✅ *(Recommended)*  

The recommended option balanced **efficiency, compliance, scalability, and measurable ROI**.

---

### 5. Business Objectives & Success Metrics
I defined **SMART objectives** directly tied to operational pain points.

#### Sample Objectives
- Reduce average processing time for simple endorsements from **5 days to 2 days**
- Reduce manual handoffs for simple endorsements by **50%**
- Deliver real-time backlog dashboards within **30 days**
- Maintain compliance error rate at **≤ 1%**

---

### 6. Financial Analysis
I built a defensible financial case to support decision-making.

**Summary**
- One-time implementation cost: **$215,000**
- Annual savings: **$525,000**
- Payback period: **< 1 year**
- 3-year ROI: **443%**

This ensured the recommendation was not only operationally sound, but financially compelling.

---

## 🔗 Traceability & Alignment
A critical focus of this case study was ensuring **end-to-end traceability** across the analysis and solution design.

I created and maintained traceability mapping to explicitly link:
- Identified pain points  
- Current-state gaps  
- Future-state process changes  
- Business goals and SMART objectives  
- KPIs and success metrics  

This ensured:
- Every solution element addressed a validated problem  
- Every objective could be traced back to a specific pain point  
- No requirements or design decisions existed in isolation  

I spent significant time **reviewing and aligning key sections together**, including:
- Problem statement and pain points  
- Gap analysis  
- Future-state workflow  
- Goals, objectives, and KPIs  

This iterative alignment strengthened the business narrative, removed inconsistencies, and resulted in a cohesive and defensible case for change.

---

## 🧪 Validation & Iterative Review Approach
To simulate real-world stakeholder challenge and sponsorship, I used **ChatGPT as a stand-in project sponsor and reviewer** throughout the case study.

I deliberately:
- Asked clarifying questions to test problem framing  
- Requested critiques of gaps, objectives, and solution logic  
- Challenged whether KPIs truly measured intended outcomes  
- Reviewed feedback and made targeted updates to improve clarity, rigor, and alignment  

This mirrors how I work with sponsors and senior stakeholders in practice—treating analysis as iterative, review-driven, and continuously refined rather than “one and done.”

## 🧠 How I Think as a Business Analyst
This case study reflects how I consistently approach business analysis work:

- **Start with the problem, not the solution**  
- **Design for differentiation, not uniformity**  
- **Maintain traceability at all times**  
- **Balance efficiency with control**  
- **Define success with measurable outcomes**  
- **Iterate through feedback and challenge**  
- **Think end-to-end, beyond individual requirements**
